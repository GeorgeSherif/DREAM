# DREAM ðŸ’­: Dialect Rewriting Enhancement for Arabic-pretrained Models
This project aims to improve the capabilities of Large Language Models for rewriting MSA text to Arabic dialects. In this project, we use MADAR corpus as the backbone dataset, while augmenting it with extra generated data using ChatGPT 4.

## How to run the code
### Generating new samples
Add your openAI key in the Data_Augmentation.py and modify the prompt to the desired dialects, and simply run it using python Data_Augmentation.py.
